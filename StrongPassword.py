# Strong Password

# A password is considered strong if:
# 1. It has at least 6 characters.
# 2. It contains at least one digit.
# 3. It contains at least one lowercase letter.
# 4. It contains at least one uppercase letter.
# 5. It contains at least one special character: !@#$%^&*()-+

# Given the password string, determine the minimum number of characters that must be added
# to make the password strong.

# Function Description:
# ---------------------
# minimumNumber(n, password):
# - n: integer, length of the password
# - password: string, current password
# Return: integer, minimum number of characters to add

# Example:
# ---------
# Input:
# 3
# Ab1
# Output:
# 3
# Explanation:
# Missing special character and length < 6 â†’ need 3 more chars to reach minimum length 6.

# Input:
# 11
# #HackerRank
# Output:
# 1
# Explanation:
# Missing one digit only.
