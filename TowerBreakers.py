Tower Breakers

Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player 1 always moves first,
and both players always play optimally.

Rules:
- Initially there are n towers.
- Each tower is of height m.
- Players alternate turns.
- In a turn, a player chooses a tower of height h and reduces its height to h' such that
  1 <= h' < h and h % h' == 0 (h' evenly divides h).
- If a player cannot make a move, they lose.

Given n and m, determine which player wins:
Return 1 if Player 1 (the first player) wins, otherwise return 2.

Example:
Input:
2 2
1 4

Output:
2
1

    Return 1 if Player 1 wins, otherwise 2.
    Rules-derived logic:
      - If m == 1: no moves possible, Player 2 wins.
      - If n is even: Player 2 can mirror Player 1's moves, so Player 2 wins.
      - Otherwise (n odd and m > 1): Player 1 wins.
